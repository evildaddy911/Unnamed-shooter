*** REQUIRES TURING FOR WINDOWS/MAC ***

Controls: mouse, keyboard (when prompted)

- Overview -
Move your character and aim your weapon using mouse controls
Once every player has chosen their location and aimed, all shots are fired simultaneously

The game host requires the '#.map' files

You can play using 1 computer and up to 4 human players with '1p game.t'

If you wish to play using multiple computers over the Internet, designate 1 computer as the server, who currently cannot play.
The server must run 'SERVER.T' and the players must run 'CLIENT.T'
The server is the only one who needs the .map files

- Rules -
There will always be 4 players per game, the remainder being server-controlled AI
If you are hit by a shot, you will respawn in your original location. You can be shot multiple times in one round
If multiple players move to the same spot, both will be awarded a kill and a death
Black tiles are walls and stop bullets
Blue tiles are water and are unpassable by players, but bullets go right over top of them
White tiles are the only thing that players can move on

*** REQUIRES TURING FOR WINDOWS/MAC ***



Controls: mouse, keyboard (when prompted)



- Overview -

Move your character and aim your weapon using mouse controls

Once every player has chosen their location and aimed, all players move and shoot simultaneously



- Rules -

If you are hit by a shot, you will respawn in your original location. You can be shot multiple times in one round

If multiple players move to the same spot, both will be awarded a kill and a death

Wall tiles block both bullets and players; water tiles are unpassable, but bullets will pass right over top

When starting, you will be asked how many players, 
** this will include AI players as well as human players **
